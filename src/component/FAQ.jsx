      question: "What is biogas, and how is it produced?",
      answer:
        "Biogas is a renewable energy source produced by the decomposition of organic matter such as food waste and agricultural residues. This process occurs in the absence of oxygen, resulting in methane-rich gas that can be used as clean energy."
    },
    {
      question: "How does waste management help the environment?",
      answer:
        "Efficient waste management reduces landfill usage, minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, and converts waste into valuable resources like biogas and compost."
    },
    {
      question: "Can biogas replace conventional fuels?",
      answer:
        "Biogas can supplement or replace conventional fuels in specific applications, such as cooking, heating, and generating electricity, offering a cleaner and more sustainable energy alternative."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I contribute to sustainable waste management?",
      answer:
        "You can start by segregating your waste, reducing plastic usage, composting organic materials, and supporting organizations that focus on sustainable waste solutions."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of using biogas?",
      answer:
        "Biogas is eco-friendly, reduces dependency on fossil fuels, provides a sustainable waste disposal solution, and generates energy that can be used for various purposes."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of waste can be used to produce biogas?",
      answer:
        "Organic waste such as food scraps, agricultural residues, animal manure, and sewage sludge can all be used to produce biogas."
    },
    {
      question: "Is biogas production safe?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when properly managed, biogas production is safe and can be an effective way to manage waste and produce renewable energy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can individuals set up biogas plants at home?",
      answer:
        "Yes, small-scale biogas plants can be set up at home for personal use, particularly in rural areas with access to organic waste."
